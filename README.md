# Building Applications with Choreo: An Internal Developer Platform Lab Session

## How an Internal Developer Platform Lets Developers Focus on Code

This hands-on lab session demonstrates how Choreo functions as an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), creating a clear separation of concerns between platform engineers and application developers. By implementing this separation, organizations can enable developers to focus entirely on writing code while platform engineers handle infrastructure, security, and governance concerns.

## Lab Outline

### Part 1: Platform Engineering Setup
Platform Engineers establish the foundational elements necessary for application development, including environments, pipelines, databases, and security policies.

### Part 2: Developer Experience
Developers leverage these pre-configured resources to build, test, and deploy applications with minimal infrastructure concerns.

### Part 3: Operational Excellence
Platform Engineers implement monitoring, alerting, and observability to ensure application reliability and performance.

### Part 4: Recap and Path Forward
Summary of achievements, benefits realized, and exploration of advanced capabilities for future implementation.

## Part 2: Developer's Perspective

Lets develop an application with Choreo. For this tutorial, we will develop a simple webapplication to manage users accounts. Using this web application, user will be able to record their expences by either uploading a receipt image or by entering the expence details manually.

#### Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

![Application Architecture](./docs/images/architecture.png)

1. **Web Application (Webapp)**: React-based frontend application that provides the user interface for expense management.

2. **API Gateway (API GW)**: Entry point for all client-side requests that handles routing and authentication.

3. **Backend for Frontend (BFF)**: Orchestration layer that optimizes and aggregates backend service calls for the frontend.

4. **Accounts Service**: Core service responsible for managing user accounts and expense records.

5. **Receipt Service**: Specialized service that processes receipt images and extracts data using OpenAI integration.

6. **Egress Gateway**: Security control point that manages and secures all outbound traffic to external services.

All components are deployed and managed through Choreo, ensuring secure communication and monitoring.


### 1. Create a new project

Choreo project allows you to group related components together. It also creates a newtwok boundry around the components and allows you to manage incoming and outgoing traffic.

1. Create a new project
    1. project display name: `Expense Tracker`
    1. Project name: `expense-tracker`
    1. Project description: `Personal Expense Tracking Application`

    1. Select correct Organization, Repository and Branch
    1. Select project directory as `expense-tracker`
    1. Click `Create`

As nextstep we will create the dependent components for our application. Tipically in an organization when building a new application you would consume existing APIs and databases. For this tutorial we will create the components that we will use in our application.
